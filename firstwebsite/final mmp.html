    <p>MMP100 | FINAL PROJECT STATEMENT</p>

    <p>Title: Rotisserie Lamb Man The Movie</p>
    <p>Semester/Year: 2nd Year</p>
    <p>Software: IMOVIE</p>

<p>I had decided to make a pseudo-documentary about the home of Rotisserie Lamb Man shutting down due to the covid-19 pandemic. My family is very high risk so I am not able to go out unless itâ€™s to work but we were able to make most of our lives online and I had a few of my friends help me with this documentary. We recorded the short documentary on modern warfare and tried to be as creative as possible. We were able to stick to the storyboard as much as possible while adding some dramatic moments in the film.
